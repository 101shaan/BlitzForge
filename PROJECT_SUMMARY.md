## Key Talking Points

### For Parents
> "I built a password security demo that shows why you need strong passwords. My custom algorithm tests 5-10 billion passwords per second, but even at that speed, a good password takes centuries to crack!"

### For CS Teachers
> "BlitzForge demonstrates low-level optimization in Rust. I designed a custom hash function with 4-lane parallelism and cache-friendly access patterns. It outperforms MD5 by 2x on CPU."

### For Technical Judges
> "This project combines algorithm design, systems programming, and security education. The BlitzHash implementation uses unsafe Rust for zero-copy operations and achieves 5-10 GH/s throughput. See BLITZHASH_EXPLAINED.md for technical details."

## Final Pitch

> "BlitzForge is a password security demonstrator built in Rust. I designed BlitzHash - a custom hash function that achieves 5-10 billion hashes per second, outperforming MD5 by 2x. Even at this extreme speed, strong passwords remain computationally safe to crack. This proves why modern systems use deliberately slow algorithms like Argon2. The project demonstrates systems programming, algorithm design, and security principles - all with professional documentation and live demonstrations."

**One sentence:** *"I built the fastest password demo tool in Rust with a custom hash algorithm."*
